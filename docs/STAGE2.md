# CrossChain Registry - Stage 2 Development Plan

## Current Status
✅ **Stage 1 Complete**: Core backend infrastructure with security-hardened verification system
- Backend canister with comprehensive security fixes
- Frontend build system operational
- Successful deployment to ICP testnet
- Security vulnerabilities addressed (URL injection, XSS, rate limiting, input sanitization)

## Next Development Phases

### Immediate Options:

**1. Security & Monitoring**
- Set up automated security scanning
- Implement proof monitoring system (checking if verification posts are still live)
- Add logging and metrics collection

**2. Core Features**
- Complete the verification system implementation (GitHub, domain, social media)
- Build the community validation features (endorsements, testimonials, vouching)
- Add cross-chain verification capabilities

**3. Frontend Development**
- Create company dashboard and profile pages
- Build search and discovery interface
- Add verification workflow UI

**4. Testing & Quality**
- Write comprehensive integration tests
- Add end-to-end testing
- Performance testing and optimization

**5. Documentation & Deployment**
- Write API documentation
- Create user guides
- Set up production deployment pipeline

## Recommended Priority Order

### Phase 2A: Core Verification System
The most impactful next steps would likely be:
- **Core verification system** (if you want users to actually verify companies)
- **Frontend interface** (if you want to demo the system)  
- **Community features** (if you want to build the trust/reputation system)

### Phase 2B: User Experience
- Complete frontend interfaces for company registration and verification
- Build search and discovery features
- Add dashboard functionality

### Phase 2C: Community & Trust
- Implement community validation features
- Add reputation scoring system
- Build endorsement and testimonial workflows

### Phase 2D: Production Readiness
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Performance optimization
- Production deployment setup
- Documentation and user guides

## Technical Foundation Ready
- ✅ Security-hardened backend
- ✅ Type-safe interfaces
- ✅ Rate limiting and input validation
- ✅ Modular architecture
- ✅ ICP deployment pipeline

Ready to proceed with any of the above development phases based on project priorities and goals.
