# CrossChain Registry - Security & Monitoring System

## Overview

✅ **COMPLETED**: A comprehensive security and monitoring system for the CrossChain Registry that provides automated threat detection, proof integrity monitoring, and community-driven trust verification.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. **Security Event Logging** 
- Real-time logging of security events with severity classification
- Event types: Rate limits, suspicious inputs, XSS attempts, URL injection, unauthorized access
- Persistent storage with timestamp tracking and principal identification
- Automated alert generation for critical/high severity events

#### 2. **Proof Monitoring System**
- Automated verification of social media proof persistence
- Scheduled monitoring tasks with retry mechanisms and exponential backoff
- Detection of deleted/modified verification posts
- Community reputation impact when proofs are tampered with

#### 3. **Community Reporting & Validation**
- Rate-limited community reporting system
- Proof status updates based on community consensus (3+ reports = Disputed)
- Evidence collection and suspicious activity tracking
- Reporter verification and anti-spam measures

#### 4. **Automated Task Scheduling**
- Hourly proof monitoring via IC timers
- Heartbeat-based high-priority task processing
- Task prioritization (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
- Automatic cleanup and maintenance routines

## Key Features

### 🛡️ Security Hardening
- **URL Injection Protection**: Domain whitelisting, HTTPS enforcement, homograph attack detection
- **Input Sanitization**: Comprehensive validation for all user inputs
- **Rate Limiting**: Multi-tier rate limiting for different operations
- **XSS Prevention**: Content sanitization and safe URL rendering

### 📊 Monitoring Capabilities
- **Proof Integrity**: Continuous monitoring of verification post availability
- **Trust Score Management**: Automatic reputation penalties for suspicious behavior
- **Community Alerts**: Real-time notifications for trust violations
- **Security Analytics**: Event aggregation and pattern detection

### 🔍 Transparency Features
- **Permanent Audit Trail**: All verification proofs permanently stored and publicly accessible
- **Community Oversight**: Decentralized monitoring and reporting
- **Trust Indicators**: Visual trust indicators based on proof status
- **Evidence Preservation**: Automatic archival of proof data

acknowledge_alert(alert_id) -> Result<()>
```

## Data Structures

### SecurityEvent
```rust
pub struct SecurityEvent {
    pub event_id: String,
    pub event_type: SecurityEventType,
    pub principal: Option<Principal>,
    pub timestamp: u64,
    pub severity: SecuritySeverity,
    pub details: String,
    pub ip_address: Option<String>,
    pub user_agent: Option<String>,
}
```

### MonitoringTask
```rust
pub struct MonitoringTask {
    pub task_id: String,
    pub task_type: TaskType,
    pub target_company_id: String,
    pub target_proof_id: Option<String>,
    pub scheduled_at: u64,
    pub priority: TaskPriority,
    pub retry_count: u32,
    pub max_retries: u32,
    pub last_error: Option<String>,
}
```

### CommunityAlert
```rust
pub struct CommunityAlert {
    pub alert_id: String,
    pub company_id: String,
    pub alert_type: AlertType,
    pub message: String,
    pub evidence: Vec<String>,
    pub created_at: u64,
    pub acknowledged: bool,
    pub severity: AlertSeverity,
}
```

## Security Event Types

### Event Classification
- **RateLimitExceeded**: Normal rate limit violations
- **SuspiciousInput**: Potentially malicious input patterns
- **XSSAttempt**: Cross-site scripting attack attempts
- **URLInjectionAttempt**: Malicious URL injection attempts
- **RepeatedFailedVerification**: Pattern of verification failures
- **UnauthorizedAccess**: Access control violations
- **ProofTampering**: Verification proof manipulation
- **BruteForceAttempt**: Credential stuffing/brute force attacks
- **SecurityScan**: Routine security audits
- **CommunityReport**: User-generated security reports

### Severity Levels
- **Low**: Minor issues, routine monitoring
- **Medium**: Suspicious patterns requiring attention
- **High**: Clear security threats, immediate logging
- **Critical**: System compromise attempts, urgent response needed

## Automated Monitoring Workflows

### 1. Proof Verification Workflow
```
Company creates verification → Proof monitoring scheduled → 
Hourly checks via HTTP → Status update (Active/Removed/Disputed) → 
Community notifications → Reputation score adjustment
```

### 2. Security Event Workflow
```
Security validation → Event logging → Severity assessment → 
Alert generation (if critical/high) → Admin notification → 
Pattern analysis → Automated response
```

### 3. Community Reporting Workflow
```
User submits report → Rate limit check → Evidence validation → 
Report storage → Consensus tracking (3+ reports) → 
Proof status update → Community alert → Reputation penalty
```
